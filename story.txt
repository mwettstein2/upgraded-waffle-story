Once upon a time in a faraway land there lived a young lion called Vera. She had a beautiful sheen of golden fur, a 
muscular frame, and heterochromatic eyes of green and blue. All the other animals in the land were terrified of her 
because legend told that animals with multicolored eyes were cursed. They all belived her to be the greatest 
predatory threat in their jungle, and never walked near her home after dusk for fear of being eaten. However, Vera 
had a secret: she was a vegetarian. Vera felt too ashamed to tell her lion friends about her unique diet, and no 
other animal would hang around her long enough to hear about it. So, after years of living in the dark, Vera decided
to open a vegetarian restaurant to come clean about her secret lifestyle. 

Vera's vegan restaurant was like a bomb dropping in the lion community. Many other lions judged her diet and despised her.  However, she also found many other lions were secretly doing a vegetarian diet. They also got discriminated against when they visit Vera's restaurant. Vera and her vegan fellows were under heavy social pressure, and they felt they were mistreated just because of their diets. Vera could not bear this anymore, and she stood out for all vegetarian animals by giving a speech at the front of Lion Mountain. Thousands of vegetarians came to attend. With cheering from the crowd, Vera began her speech: "I have a dream......"
